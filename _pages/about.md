# Biography

I'm a four-year undergraduate student (expected to graduate at June 2019) majoring in Computer Science in Fudan University. I'm now supervised by [Prof. Xipeng Qiu](<http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/xpqiu/>) at [FudanNLP Laboratory](<https://github.com/FudanNLP>). 

I joined in [Shanghai Key Laboratory of Data Science](https://datascience.fudan.edu.cn/) in my sophomore year supervised by [Prof. Yitong Wang](https://datascience.fudan.edu.cn/e1/64/c13398a123236/page.htm) and start my research in machine learning and social network data mining. Focusing on link prediction on Weighted Signed Social Network, we successfully built a new algorithm called MFLG and summarized our work in a paper. See details in my CV.

In my junior year, I was lucky to be an exchange student in [the University of Manchester](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/) from Sep, 2018 to Jan, 2019. This year I started my work in Computer Vision, especially in **object detection and segmentation** and focused on unsupervised object detection algorithm based on VAE & RNN and trying to do this job in more realistic images. 

In summer 2019, I was so glad to join [Prof. David Crandall](https://cs.indiana.edu/~djcran/) 's great [IU Computer Vision Lab](http://vision.soic.indiana.edu/people/). I was focusing on automatic semantic segmentation and human-inspired computer vision and neuroscience.

# Interest

I love basketball and I'm also a big fan of [Stepfen Curry](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%AF%E8%92%82%E8%8A%AC%C2%B7%E7%A7%91%E9%87%8C), MVP point guard of Golden State Warriors, NBA. I'm a team member of my class's basketball team and often play **Score / Power forward (SF/PF)**. In my spare time, I also play the role of a **basketball game referee**. Hope one day I can have a chance to see a home game of Warriors in Chase Center San Francisco!
