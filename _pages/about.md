# Introduction

I am a coming PhD student in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) Computer Science and Engineer Department (CSE) in Sep 2020, co-advised by [Prof. Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/) and [Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung](https://sites.google.com/view/dyyeung/home?authuser=0). Before that, I am currently a four-year undergraduate student (expected to graduate at June 2020) majoring in Computer Science in Fudan University.

My research interests include Computer Vision and Machine Learning, especially in few shot learning, weakly supervised vision problems and specific vision applications.

# Interest

I love basketball and I'm also a big fan of [Stepfen Curry](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%AF%E8%92%82%E8%8A%AC%C2%B7%E7%A7%91%E9%87%8C), MVP point guard of Golden State Warriors, NBA. I'm a team member of my class's basketball team and often play **Score / Power forward (SF/PF)**. In my spare time, I also play the role of a **basketball game referee**. Hope one day I can have a chance to see a home game of Warriors in Chase Center San Francisco!
