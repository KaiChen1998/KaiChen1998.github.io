# Introduction

I am a coming PhD student in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) Computer Science and Engineer Department in Sep 2020. Before that, I am currently a four-year undergraduate student (expected to graduate at June 2020) majoring in Computer Science in Fudan University supervised by [Prof. Xipeng Qiu](<http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/xpqiu/>) at [FudanNLP Laboratory](<https://github.com/FudanNLP>). 

My research interests include Computer Vision and Machine Learning, especially in few shot learning, weakly supervised vision problems and specific vision applications.

# Interest

I love basketball and I'm also a big fan of [Stepfen Curry](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%AF%E8%92%82%E8%8A%AC%C2%B7%E7%A7%91%E9%87%8C), MVP point guard of Golden State Warriors, NBA. I'm a team member of my class's basketball team and often play **Score / Power forward (SF/PF)**. In my spare time, I also play the role of a **basketball game referee**. Hope one day I can have a chance to see a home game of Warriors in Chase Center San Francisco!
