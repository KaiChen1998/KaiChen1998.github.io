# Introduction
I am a PhD student in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) Computer Science and Engineer Department (CSE), co-supervised by [Prof. Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/) and [Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung](https://sites.google.com/view/dyyeung/home?authuser=0). Before that, I was an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science in Fudan University supervised by [Prof. Yanwei Fu](<https://yanweifu.github.io/>). My research interests include Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence, especially in high-level vision perception, unsupervised learning and multimodality learning.

# Interest
I love basketball and I'm also a big fan of [Stepfen Curry](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%AF%E8%92%82%E8%8A%AC%C2%B7%E7%A7%91%E9%87%8C), MVP point guard of Golden State Warriors, NBA. I'm a team member of my class's basketball team and often play **Score / Power forward (SF/PF)**. In my spare time, I also play the role of a **basketball game referee**. Hope one day I can have a chance to see a home game of Warriors in Chase Center San Francisco!
